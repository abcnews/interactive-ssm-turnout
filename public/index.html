          <p>This week, all Australians on the electoral roll will be posted a survey asking them: "Should the law be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry?"</p>
          <p>Can you predict the outcome based on the opinion polls and expected voter turnout?</p>
          <a name="scrollytellerLIGHTtrueALIGNrightIDa"> </a>
          <p>Two key factors that will determine the result of the same-sex marriage survey are the number of voters in favour or against the change, and the number of people who will turn out for the vote.</p>
          <p>Both of those factors differ by age and this chart shows how they affect the outcome.</p>
          <p>On the X axis is the percentage of people who say they will vote 'Yes' in favour of changing the law to allow same-sex couples to marry, according to the latest opinion poll.</p>
          <p>The coloured dots represent three age groups and the further to the right they are, the higher proportion in favour of change.</p>
          <p>On the Y-axis is the percentage of people on the electoral roll who say they intend to vote. The higher up the chart, the more people in each age group are likely to vote.</p>
          <p>So voter turnout and percent in favour can both affect the result and these differ by age group.</p>
          <a name="markIDa"> </a>
          <p>The latest opinion poll shows that 59 per cent of Australians supported changing the law to allow same-sex couples to marry.</p>
          <p>But young and old people are a long way apart – 69 per cent of those aged 18 to 34 are in favour, compared with 49 per cent of those aged 55 and over.</p>
          <p>Still, if 100 percent of people on the electoral roll voted in the survey according to the opinion polls, the result would be 56 per cent for 'Yes'.</p>
          <p>For this calculation, we made the assumption that all the people who said they 'Don't know' in answer to the question about changing the marriage law and have removed them from the total number of voters. That's around 11 percent of voters.</p>
          <a name="markIDb"> </a>
          <p>What if those voters who said they 'Don't know' about changing the law in the opinion polls all voted 'No'. How would that change the result?</p>
          <p>The vote to change the law would be supported, but with a reduced majority of 57 per cent 'Yes' votes.</p>
          <a name="markIDc"> </a>
          <p>But the survey is voluntary, and not only that, the responses need to be sent by snail mail. That might mean young people are less likely to vote.</p>
          <p>Look what happens using the latest poll results on the number of people who said they would 'Definitely' or 'Probably' vote in the survey in each age group.</p>
          <p>Again, the people who said they 'Don't know' have been excluded from the total.</p>
          <p>Even though there would be more than 1.7 million more votes cast by those over 55 than the 18 to 34 age group, the result is the same - 64 per cent in favour of same-sex marriage.</p>
          <a name="markIDd"> </a>
          <p>But what happens if only those who said they would 'Definitely' vote in the survey are considered?</p>
          <p>The result is still the same – 64 per cent in favour of same-sex marriage.</p>
          <a name="markIDe"> </a>
          <p>Saying you're going to vote is one thing, but how many people will actually send back their survey forms?</p>
          <p>The only similar Federal poll that gives an indication was held in 1997.</p>
          <p>It was also a voluntary postal survey, to vote for delegates of a Constitutional Convention to consider whether Australia should become a republic.</p>
          <p>Less than half of people on the electoral roll voted, and only a third of 18 to 25 year olds.</p>
          <p>Using those participation rates, the result is almost the same – 63 per cent in favour of same-sex marriage.</p>
          <a name="markIDf"> </a>
          <p>What about an extreme example, where none of those aged 18 to 34 vote?</p>
          <p>Using those in the other two age groups who said they would 'Definitely' or 'Probably' vote, the 'Yes' vote still comes out ahead – 59 per cent.</p>
          <a name="markIDg"> </a>
          <p>There's no guarantee people will vote in the same-sex marriage survey the same way as the 1000 respondents in opinion polls.</p>
          <p>Although in Ireland in 2015, 62 per cent of voters gave the thumbs up to same-sex marriage, replicating opinion polls results before the referendum.</p>
          <p>A 10 per cent fall in the 'Yes' vote across all age groups would see the 'Yes' vote drop, but still get over the line at 53 per cent.</p>
          <a name="markIDhEDITABLEtrue"> </a>
          <h2>Your turn</h2>
          <p>Try changing the voter turnout or support for same-sex marriage percentages and see how it affects the result.</p>
